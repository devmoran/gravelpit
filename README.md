Gravelpit
==============

[Gravelpit](http://www.gravelpit.co) is a service which offers unique, high-quality sounds for creative projects. Simply, it provides bundles of sounds for use in your games, web interfaces, smartphone apps or whatever else. 

This [manual](https://github.com/devmoran/gravelpit/wiki) aims to distil down the FAQs that support the main website.

## Manual for basic audio
I've written what I hope is an approachable set of instructions for both beginners and experienced designers and developers in the [Wiki](https://github.com/devmoran/gravelpit/wiki). This'll get you started with integrating, playing and converting sounds in your project.
