Gravelpit
=========

#### Unique, high-quality sounds for creative projects
Gravelpit provides bundles of sounds for use in your games, web interfaces, smartphone apps or whatever else

## Purpose
This repo will contain technical documentation to support Gravelpit (http://www.gravelpit.co). The aim is to put together a mini-manual of some basic principles on audio for the digital world and how best to implement it. 

There's a dearth in the software community when it comes to information on sound and audio integration, and I often get asked similar or identical questions on every project, so this manual is a way of capturing knowledge for my reference and for that of others.


##### In the manual:

> * Introduction to audio formats
> * Implementing audio for smartphone applications
> * Tools of the trade (things I use and love)
> * Converting audio (quick start guide)
